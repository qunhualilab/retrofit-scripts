# Scripts for running stereoscope
stereoscope_code.R shows how to run stereoscope for the Mouse brain cerebellum ST tissue generated by slide-seq technology and simulation data. Mouse brain ST data loaded here is already pre-processed using steps mentioned in the Methods paper section named "Mouse cerebellum data analysis". For simultaion data, we use the data where we have spots with 10 cells of up to 3 types per spot and a reference of all 10 true cell types provided.
