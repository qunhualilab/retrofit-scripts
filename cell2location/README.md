# Scripts for running Cell2location
Cell2location_cerebellum.R shows how to run Cell2location for the Mouse brain cerebellum ST tissue generated by slide-seq technology. The ST data loaded here is already pre-processed using steps mentioned in the Methods paper section named "Mouse cerebellum data analysis".

Cell2location_simulation.R shows how to run Cell2location for simulation data. For this demonstration, we use the data for the simulated case where we have spots with 10 cells of up to 3 types per spot and a reference of all 10 true cell types provided. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell reference.

Cell2location_colon.R shows how to run Cell2location for Human colon ST tissue generated by 10X Visium technology. For this demonstration, we use the fetal tissue collected at 12 post-conception weeks. The ST data loaded here is already pre-processed using steps mentioned in the Methods paper section named "Human intestine data analysis". We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell and marker reference.
