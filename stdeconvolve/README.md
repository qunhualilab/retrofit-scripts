# Scripts for running STdeconvolove

STdeconvolove_cerebellum.R shows how to run STdeconvolove for the Mouse brain cerebellum ST tissue generated by slide-seq technology. The ST data loaded here is already pre-processed using steps mentioned in the Methods paper section named "Mouse cerebellum data analysis".

STdeconvolove_simulation.R shows how to run STdeconvolove for simulated data. For this demonstration, we use the data for the simulated case where we have spots with 10 cells of up to 3 types per spot and a reference of all 10 true cell types provided. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell reference.

STdeconvolove_colon.R shows how to run STdeconvolove for Human colon ST tissue generated by 10X Visium technology. For this demonstration, we use the fetal tissue collected at 12 post-conception weeks. The ST data loaded here is already pre-processed using steps mentioned in the Methods paper section named "Human intestine data analysis"
