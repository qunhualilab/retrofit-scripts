# retrofit-scripts

retrofit_simulation.R shows how to run RETROFIT for simulated data. For this demonstration, we use the data for the simulated case where we have spots with 10 cells of up to 3 types per spot and a reference of all 10 true cell types provided. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell reference.
