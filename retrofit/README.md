# Scripts for running RETROFIT

retrofit_simulation.R shows how to run RETROFIT for simulated data. For this demonstration, we use the data for the simulated case where we have spots with 10 cells of up to 3 types per spot and a reference of all 10 true cell types provided. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell reference.

retrofit_cerebellum.R shows how to run RETROFIT for the Mouse brain cerebellum ST tissue generated by slide-seq technology. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell and marker reference.

retrofit_simulation.R shows how to run RETROFIT for Human colon ST tissue generated by 10X Visium technology. For this demonstration, we use the fetal tissue collected at 12 post-conception weeks. We deconvolve the data and annotate results using single-cell and marker reference.
